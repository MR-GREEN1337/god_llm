# Core Concepts Overview

## Introduction
The God LLM system is an advanced framework for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep contextual reasoning and knowledge exploration. Drawing inspiration from Proverbs 2:6, it aims to provide wisdom and understanding through structured thought processes.

## Key Components

### 1. Node-Based Knowledge Structure
The system organizes knowledge and reasoning in a graph-like structure where:
- Each node represents a thought or response to a prompt
- Nodes maintain parent-child relationships
- Nodes can have lateral relationships with other nodes based on semantic similarity
- Each node contains:
  - The original prompt
  - The LLM's thought/response
  - Context history
  - Relationships to other nodes

### 2. Scoring Metrics
The system evaluates reasoning paths using multiple sophisticated metrics:

- **Depth Score**: Measures how deep and thorough the reasoning is
- **Relation Score**: Evaluates lateral connections between nodes
- **Coherence Score**: Assesses logical flow and consistency between connected thoughts
- **Novelty Score**: Measures uniqueness of insights compared to existing nodes
- **Context Retention**: Evaluates how well context is maintained throughout the reasoning chain
- **Hierarchy Score**: Assesses the strength of parent-child relationships in the reasoning path

### 3. Core Operations

#### Expand Operation
- Takes a prompt and generates a thoughtful response
- Creates follow-up questions to explore the topic deeper
- Builds a tree of interconnected thoughts
- Maintains context awareness through previous interactions
- Implements relevance checking and retry mechanisms

#### Pray Operation
- Discovers and evaluates all possible paths through the knowledge graph
- Computes comprehensive scores for each path
- Returns the top-k paths based on scoring metrics
- Enables identification of the most valuable reasoning chains

#### Miracle Operation
- Builds upon the Pray operation
- Generates human-readable summaries of the best reasoning paths
- Can output results in Markdown format for documentation
- Provides detailed metrics and analysis of each path

### 4. Context Management
- Maintains a sliding window of previous interactions
- Builds enhanced prompts that include relevant context
- Ensures coherence and continuity in reasoning chains
- Implements similarity-based relationship discovery

### 5. Quality Control
- Evaluates and filters generated questions for quality
- Implements retry mechanisms for irrelevant responses
- Maintains similarity thresholds for relationship building
- Provides comprehensive debugging and logging capabilities

## Key Features

## Best Practices

1. **Configuration**
   - Set appropriate similarity thresholds based on your use case
   - Adjust context window size based on memory requirements
   - Configure max iterations based on desired exploration depth

2. **Usage**
   - Start with clear, well-defined prompts
   - Use the miracle operation for generating readable summaries
   - Enable debugging for detailed insight into system operation

3. **Performance**
   - Monitor node count to prevent excessive memory usage
   - Use appropriate batch sizes for question generation
   - Consider context window size impact on performance

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Memory Management**
   - Implement node cleanup for irrelevant branches
   - Monitor and limit maximum node count
   - Consider context window size impact

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed generations
   - Handle edge cases in path exploration
   - Maintain fallback strategies for scoring failures

3. **Scalability**
   - Consider batch processing for large operations
   - Implement efficient path finding algorithms
   - Optimize similarity computations
